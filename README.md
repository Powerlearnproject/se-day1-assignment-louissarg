# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is a tool to develop and maintain high qulity softwear systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): This approach emphasized breaking down programs into smaller, manageable functions.
Development of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming introduced the concept of objects.
Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001): Agile methodologies shifted software development from rigid

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
design- creating high level detaild softwear,architecture.
testing- conducting tests to ensure softwear meets quality standards.
maintenance- providing ongoing suport and updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall- seqacential approach with distinct phases eg.requiments,design,implementaion 
Agile-iterative and increments approach focuses on flexibility,collabration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software dev- Are responsible for writing code and implimenting software solutions.
Quality Ass- ensure software qulity by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager- Oversee the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
its a software suites that provides tools for writing, debugging and testing code

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines-to deliver software products on time can result in rushing development
techical debt happens from shortcuts or suboptimal.
all this can be aviod if work is planned out and a good work system is being followed



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.ter
integration - interaction between different components or subsystems.
system-is to test the entire software system as a whole.
acceptence-is software requirments that ensure they meet the needs of the users needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
responsible for crafting and improving text queries and instructions to AI instruments and the more special the imput is the better the results you get

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
please give a easy solution for grade 5 students on how to plan out study material for history class.
a be very detailed on how you ask your question
